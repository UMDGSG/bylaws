  \item Any student currently enrolled in a graduate degree granting program.
  \item Any University office or department, as long as the proposed event will benefit graduate students.
\end{bylaws-number}
  \item Funding shall not be allocated to events that meet the following criteria:
\begin{bylaws-number} 
  \item An event that denies participation or attendance to any currently enrolled graduate student. Participation and attendance must be open to all graduate students. When limits on the number of participants are necessary, the GSO or graduate student applying for funding (hereafter “planning entity”) must clearly state the maximum number of participants and the reason behind any restrictions, which must comply with the restrictions set forth in Article 7.1.C.
  \item An event that is engaged in activities that result in personal financial gain for individual members of the planning entity (not precluding the payment of wages or honoraria pursuant to a supervised contract for services).
  \item An event at which graduate students are not expected to constitute a majority of the attendees/participants, unless the event is intended to provide opportunities for developing student leadership and civic engagement skills or support student-run learning experiences outside of the formal classroom.
\end{bylaws-number}
  \item Funding Limits
\begin{bylaws-number}
  \item Each EFR will normally be limited to five-percent of the total amount of money allocated to the funding of EFRs by the GSG operating budget.
  \item A GSO or department may submit an EFR that requests more than five-percent of the EFR budget, though such requests must be formally presented to the Assembly for approval.
  \item No EFR submitted by an individual graduate student may be approved for more than five-percent by either the BFC or the Assembly.
  \item EFR events may only be funded from the budget of the fiscal year in which they occur.
  \item No BFC may approve funding for an event that takes place in a subsequent fiscal year.
\end{bylaws-number}
  \item Procedures for Considering Event Funding Requests
\begin{bylaws-number}
  \item In order to be eligible for funding, each planning entity requesting funds from the GSG must submit an EFR at least one month before the date of the event. Under extraordinary circumstances, the BFC may consider EFRs submitted after this deadline at its discretion. The GSG shall accept only one EFR per event. In the case that a revision is necessary, the BFC shall consider revised budgets provided the following:
\begin{enumerate}[i]
  \item The reason for and necessity of the change is fully explained in the revision.
  \item The revision is submitted sufficiently in advance of the event for the BFC to consider it.
\end{enumerate}
  \item Each EFR should include:
\begin{enumerate}[i]
  \item In the case of proposals by GSOs, the group’s vision, mission, and goals.
  \item In the case of proposals by individuals, a list of individuals involved in planning the event.
  \item A description of the event that includes its priorities or goals.
  \item A marketing plan.

  \item An assessment of who will most likely attend the event, the total number of attendees expected, and past attendance numbers, if applicable.
  \item A line item budget including a detailed description of each expenditure.
\end{enumerate}
  \item All EFRs must be submitted through the online EFR system.
  \item If the planning entity has other sources of funding, those amounts and any requirements for such funding must be disclosed, and contact numbers for any other funding entities must be included with the EFR. The BFC reserves the right to verify the accuracy of the information provided, and reevaluate funding decisions if new information becomes available. If the planning entity has access to significant funding from sources outside the GSG, the BFC or the Assembly should set GSG funding levels accordingly.
  \item Given the Assembly is in recess during the months of July and August, no EFRs for more than five-percent of the yearly EFR budget may be funded during that period. EFRs for events taking place in September that request more than five-percent may only be funded if there is adequate time for the Assembly to consider the EFR before the event takes places, according to the timelines established in Article 7.5.G.
\end{bylaws-number}
  \item Additional restrictions on EFR expenditures:
\begin{bylaws-number}

\begin{bylaws-number}
  \item The BFC will review all requests for funding that are under five-percent of the yearly EFR budget and decide what level of funding to award each request.
  \item All eligible GSOs, departments, or graduate students will be given the opportunity to present their funding requests in writing and, should they desire, in a formal presentation to the BFC. The planning entity may request such a presentation, or the BFC may ask the entity for a presentation (lasting no more than fifteen minutes) when the committee finds it necessary to facilitate the allocation decision process.
  \item The BFC will provide the planning entity with a decision within seven calendar days of the original submission of the EFR.
  \item Any urgent requests for monies in a time frame less than the required one month must be approved for consideration by the Vice President for Financial Affairs before coming before the BFC.

\begin{bylaws-number}
  \item Providing that there are EFR funds still exceeding five-percent of the yearly EFR budget available, requests for funds exceeding five-percent of the yearly EFR budget must be presented to the Assembly for approval. Since the Assembly meets once each month during the session, requests for more than five-percent of the EFR budget must be submitted at least six weeks prior to the event date to allow for a presentation to be scheduled. The BFC may provisionally approve such an EFR for a lesser amount (not to exceed five-percent of the yearly EFR budget); should the planning entity decide before the date of its presentation to the Assembly to lower the request to the amount provisionally approved by the BFC, the entity may forego an appearance before the Assembly and be approved through the normal EFR process.
  \item The BFC shall submit to the Assembly its funding recommendations in the form of a report which shall be treated as a main motion on the agenda of the Assembly meeting in question.
  \item When the EFR comes before the Assembly for consideration, the Vice President for Financial Affairs or another member of the BFC shall present the committee report to the Assembly and explain its recommendations.
  \item After the presentation of the report, the planning entity must make its presentation no longer than five minutes and answer such questions as the Assembly may have.
  \item Upon the conclusion of the planning entity’s presentation, the Assembly shall immediately move to consideration of the question on whether to accept the committee’s recommendations. The Assembly shall debate the recommendations of the committee report according to its standard procedures, and amendments to them shall be in order.
  \item Once the time allotted for debate has elapsed and all amendments have been considered, the Assembly shall vote on the committee’s recommendations (as amended, if applicable).
  \item Once the total allotted amount has been decided upon, the planning entity will be immediately informed of the Assembly’s decision by the Presiding Officer of the Assembly.
  \item The BFC will have five days to specify which line items the money should be allocated toward, and to inform the planning entity of their decision.
\end{bylaws-number}
  \item EFR Appeal Process \hfill \\
When funds are denied for an event, the planning entity may appeal the decision. The process is as follows:
\begin{bylaws-number}
  \item Appeal process to the BFC
\begin{enumerate}[i]
  \item Any appeal must be filed within forty-eight hours of the announcement of the funding decision. The appeal must be submitted by email, and should clearly state the grounds for the appeal.
  \item The appeal should be carefully reasoned, detailing why the planning entity thinks that the decision is unfair or unfounded. Including possible changes to the event and EFR that might satisfy the BFC’s concerns is welcome and encouraged.
  \item The BFC will consider the appeal, make its decision, and notify the planning entity within forty-eight hours of its receipt of the appeal.
  \item In the event of a denial of the appeal, the organizers may appeal to the Assembly as described below.
\end{enumerate}
  \item Appeal process to the Assembly
\begin{enumerate}[i]
  \item Any appeal must be filed at least forty-eight hours prior to the Assembly meeting at which the appeal is to be presented. Because meetings are only held once a month during each session, planning entities should consider this when submitting their EFR.
  \item The appeal should be carefully reasoned, detailing why the planning entity thinks that the decision is unfair or unfounded.
  \item Once added to the Assembly meeting agenda, the planning entity will have four minutes to present its appeal and five minutes to answer the Assembly’s questions.
  \item The Assembly shall then review the appeal and vote on whether to uphold the BFC’s ruling. The Assembly’s decision shall be final, and not subject to appeal.
\end{enumerate}
\end{bylaws-number}
  \item Letter/Email of Award \hfill \\
When funds are approved for an event, the BFC will issue a letter/email of award to the planning entity. This letter of award will constitute the GSG’s official commitment to fund the event, and it should be accompanied by the approved budget when presented to other campus units for disbursement of funds.
  \item Post Event Report \hfill \\
After the completion of any event that has received EFR funding, the planning entity must submit a short description of the event and photographs, if available, to the GSG for posting on the GSG website within two weeks of the event. Failure to submit this report within four weeks of the event will result in automatic sanctions that make the planning entity ineligible for funding for a full calendar year.
  \item Sanctions
\begin{bylaws-number}
  \item If a planning entity does not submit a post event report within two weeks of its EFR event, the Vice President for Financial Affairs shall send an email to the planning entity reminding it of the required report and that failure to submit a report within four weeks of the event will result in sanctions. If a report is not submitted, the Vice President for Financial Affairs shall email the planning entity with the following information:
  \begin{enumerate}[i]
    \item An announcement of the start of the sanction period,
    \item The date on which the sanction will expire,
    \item An explanation of the appeal procedures outlined in Article 7.5.K.2.
  \end{enumerate}
    \item Appeals to these sanctions may be submitted to the Assembly for consideration at any time prior to the expiration of the period of ineligibility. Any such appeal shall be considered using the following procedures:
    \begin{enumerate}[i]
      \item The appeal must be filed with the Vice President for Legislative Affairs at least three weeks prior to the Assembly meeting at which the planning entity wishes to present its appeal. After verifying with the Vice President for Financial Affairs that the group has been sanctioned, the Vice President for Legislative Affairs shall schedule the appeal at an appropriate place in the agenda of the next Assembly meeting.
      \item At the meeting at which they are to present, the sanctioned planning entity will have four minutes to present its appeal and five minutes to answer the Assembly’s questions. The appeal should be carefully reasoned, detailing why the planning entity thinks that the decision is unfair or unfounded, or explaining why an exception to the GSG’s policies should be made. The Vice President for Financial Affairs, or his or her designee, should present the background for the BFC’s decision.
      \item The Assembly shall then review the appeal and vote on whether to lift the sanctions. The Assembly’s decision shall be final, and not subject to appeal.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{bylaws-number}
  \item EFR Conflict of Interest Transparency \hfill \\
  When an Event Funding Request (EFR) is submitted the applicant Graduate Student Organization (GSO) must list all GSG members that are also members of their GSO. This is inclusive of program representatives and members the Budget and Finance Committee (BFC). GSG members that are members of the applicant GSO as defined by the organization’s bylaws and/or constitution, will not be allowed to vote on any funding decisions within the BFC (if they are committee members) or Assembly meetings. These GSG members must identify themselves before discussion begins at Assembly meetings and excuse themselves from closed discussion and voting at Assembly meetings for funding requests exceeding 5\% of the EFR budget, as detailed in 7.5.G.1. Failure of the GSO to identify GSG representative members may result in sanctions as detailed in
  \item BFC committee members that fail to identify themselves as concurrent members of the applicant GSO will be (1) removed from the BFC for the remainder of their tenure as a graduate student and (2) will not be allowed to vote on funding decisions for the remainder of their tenure as GSG representatives. GSG representatives that fail to identify themselves during Assembly meeting discussions detailed in 7.5.G.1 will not be allowed to vote on funding decisions for the remainder of their tenure as GSG representatives. GSG members who are also members of the applicant GSO as defined above, cannot represent the GSO for funding requests that require approval before the General Assembly or the BFC.
  \item BFC Best Practices \hfill \\
  The Budget and Finance Committee (BFC) will maintain a Best Practices document to be freely available to Graduate Student Organizations (GSOs) submitting Event Funding Requests (EFRs). These Best Practices will be guidelines for the operation of the BFC in reviewing and awarding EFRs and shall provide guidance to GSOs to aid the completion of successful applications. The Best Practices will be eligible for review and discussion within the BFC and should be regularly updated by the Vice President for Financial Affairs (VPFA) and the committee members according to the changing needs of the Graduate Student Government (GSG).
